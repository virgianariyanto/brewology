                <p>Our story began in 2010 with a simple idea: to bring the best coffee to everyone. We started in our hometown of Seattle, where we learned to roast our beans and brew the perfect cup of coffee. Since then, we've grown to over 100 locations worldwide, but our commitment to quality has never wavered. We're proud to serve our customers the best coffee in the world, every day.</p>
